# ATM machine in C

A C program that simulates basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) functions for a single user. This project is ideal for learning about functions, variables, loops, and conditional logic.

## About the Project

This project is a basic simulation of an ATM system. It reinforces foundational C programming concepts such as:

- Function declarations and definitions
- Modular code design
- User input/output handling
- Control flow with loops and conditional statements

## Features

- Check account balance: Displays the current account balance. Takes balance as a parameter.
- Deposit money: Prompts the user to input a deposit amount and adds it to the balance. Uses a pointer to modify the actual balance variable.
- Withdraw money: Prompts the user to input a withdrawal amount. Checks for sufficient funds before subtracting from the balance. Uses a pointer to modify the balance.
- Exit the program
